1,1,5/24/2006,8:10,"This water tastes ok, but after receiving my testers, it tested extremely high for contaminants! Why would you sell contaminated water? To be sure, I used a digital yesterday as some strips can give inaccurate readings and it was even worse. I'm throwing these in the trash! I wish I would've waited for these testers before exposing my family to this water.",101,1
2,3,7/10/2007,9:25,"heard about this on compas radio, decided to give it a try.",102,2
3,5,5/31/2012,15:10,It is locked and stilll Amazon sell it at fuuulllll price?,103,3
4,3,9/19/2018,23:35,I love the feel of the keyboard - the keys press very easily and the added light is a plus if I’m working early morning or late night.,104,4
5,2,7/29/2019,23:45,"Tried repeatedly to get to work, spent several hours on phone trying to chat with over burdened “customer support” to no avail. Would work for a short time and then screen would go blank and when it was working, no sound. Customer Support was one of the most frustrating chat support services I have ever encountered.",105,5
6,5,9/11/2013,0:45,I read reviews and bought a medium to be safe and wish that I hadn’t. They’re big and I feel that the shape isn’t flattering at all (saggy diaper bum). The fabric is super soft so I’m disappointed about the fit but gifted them to my mother who’s quite happy not only with the style and colour but that she didn’t have to pay for them lol,106,6
7,4,11/7/2014,1:00,"A great fun watch, lots of sparkle from the crystals, but still easy to read. The size of the face is fairly large, making it more sized for a man's wrist, and accordingly it is thicker than what I would usually wear. Somehow the chain came in perfectly sized for my wrist!",107,7
8,4,6/10/2015,6:15,Stylish and easy to maneuver. Spent so many years with heavy and hard to maneuver luggage. Wish I purchased this years ago.,108,8
9,3,7/9/2018,13:50,"I ordered these for my husband who lives in Crocs since his back surgery as he can no longer bend to tie shoes. He loves the extra traction this style provides. I have always ordered him size mens 10. These run a little bigger than the classic Crocs but not enough bigger that he wanted to return them, looks about like 1/2 size bigger.",109,9
10,4,1/11/2021,14:30,"I have purchased the wipes many times, and was satisfied with its quality. However, the recent packaging I received needs to be opened at sides, which has no resealable plastic as it used to have, and makes the wipes dry out quickly. So disappointed.",110,10
11,5,11/6/2003,5:45,"This is the second time to buy this product. However, this product made me feel broken! As shown in the picture, these comminuted walnuts make me feel a headache! Such a powdered walnut. This disappoints me.2 packages are good and 2 packages are completely shredded.",111,11
12,3,6/9/2004,9:45,I was so excited about these chips until I received them today and saw that they were 8 days away from expiring!!! Will definitely not be purchasing again!!!,112,12
13,1,2/2/2009,17:20,"I received a battery today (10/18/21), that expired on 12/20. Not cool! If it weren't for my older dog being so scared by the loud noise when I put it in the carbon monoxide detector, I would return it. Bad business!",113,13
14,5,1/11/2012,21:05,"If you have acne prone skin PLEASE do not buy this product! I started getting an extreme increase in acne after just 2 weeks of using this product! The high amount of B12 caused a break out for me! They advertise that the product will clear up skin and that is false! My skin here is typically 100% clear and red bumps turned to pimples to small pustules! Stopping this product cleared my skin back up! I may be a rare case, but if you have acne prone skin, be safe and stay far away from this product!",114,14
15,3,4/1/2014,22:05,"My toddler loves this. I also am obsessed with the fact that it DOESN’T LEAK!!! This was the #1 reason for my purchase. Though it’s indestructible (which I love) I will have to admit that it has been destroying my hardwood floors as my daughter drops it. Ease of use and durability are however 2 thumbs up! Also, if you’re a little hesitant because of the price, don’t stress, it will last for ages!",115,15
16,4,11/6/2003,13:40,Doesn't hold the battery charge. If your car is crashed parked don't gonna record anything.Less than one month bought it,116,16
17,3,6/9/2004,14:15,Really interesting game! We had a lot of fun with our friends!,117,17
18,2,2/2/2009,14:20,"Bought this for my son to use for his school stuff and basketball gear every Friday (that’s 1x a week!) when he has practice right after school. This bag did not last past 4 mos. and it’s falling apart! That’s a total of 16 days!? We really like the size and design of this bag but you’ll never know the true quality until you try it out. Well, it’s true that you get what you pay for. I hope this review will help others to make a better decision.",118,18
19,2,1/11/2012,15:05,"After approximately a dozen outings, the kayak seems to be holding up very well. The seats give great back support and are comfortable. The construction and materials are good quality. The ride is stable and easy to paddle and maneuver. It inflates and deflates easy for storage. However, I use a 12v electric pump (purchased separate) and not the included one. The only con would be that it’s a little short for two adults. Good for an adult and child or adult and dog (I take my dog out in the kayak).",119,19
20,4,4/1/2014,19:45,"Great hammock and works amazing. The straps are good quality however in my case need to get longer staps. On a hot day in the shade you will be cool, so a underquilt will be needed if you plan to use in fall or winter.For the seller the delivery was quick, I purchased in 2020 and wanted to use it good for an accurate review. Seems to hold up well under regular use this far. Product is as described by seller.I can not comment on customer service but would order again from this seller.",120,20
